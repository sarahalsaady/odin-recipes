<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Biscoff Lazy Cake is made with just four ingredients, and no cooking required! Simply refrigerate until set, and
    relish the sweet, luscious lotus cookie flavor; a delightful dessert.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lotus Biscoff cookies</li>
    <li>Biscoff cookie butter</li>
    <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In your stand or hand mixer, start with 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and whip at medium-low speed. When soft
        peaks begin to form, add the powdered sugar and increase to medium-high speed. After a minute or so, as stiff
        peaks take shape, add ¾ cup of Biscoff cookie butter. Whisk for another minute until fully incorporated.</li>
    <li>Line an 8×4 baking pan with enough plastic wrap to be able to fully cover the cake once done.</li>
    <li>Line the baking pan with enough lotus cooking (word side down) to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Gently break the remaining lotus cookies with your hands, about 3 pieces per cookie and add to the whipped cream
        mixture. Mix to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour the whipped cream mixture into the baking pan, ensuring a smooth top. Line the pan with the remaining Lotus
        cookies (word side up).</li>
    <li>Retrieve the Biscoff Lazy Cake from the fridge and carefully unwrap it. Flip the cake onto a serving platter.
    </li>
    <li>Warm up ¼ cup of lotus cookie butter in the microwave and drizzle over the top of the cake. Serve chilled.</li>
